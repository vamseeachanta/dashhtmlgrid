# Introduction

Data science typically involves data, analysis, tests and outputs. A simple way to review, verify or present results is via Visualizations.

Plotly Dash is selected to help prepare and present visualizations in a single dashboard. The key is to help present results in a organized manner to avoid 

# Summary

A library is under development to standardize this. See [dashhtmlgrid](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/dashhtmlgrid)

**#TODO**
- A decidated plotly visualization library is required to help develop faster custom plotting
    - The data provided to charts should be dedicated dfs with simple configuration files


# Usage

- Prepare data
- Define html div matrix using app layout (based on expected outputs). Some examples are:
    - 
- Utilize standard elements to plug into each matrix divs charts, tables 

The library currently supports:
- 1 dropdown menu box (with only 1 input field)
- multiple tables
- multiple plots
